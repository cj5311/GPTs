Ingredients

Carrot ribbons (just use a peeler for speed)
Frozen peas
Red cabbage
Yellow peppers
Red onion

1 tsp miso paste
1 tsp of Chinese five spice
2 tbsp of soy sauce
1 tbsp of oil
100g white rice

","
Method

Cook the rice as instructed on the packaging.


While the rice cooks, prep the vegetables. I like a mix of diced, ribbon, julienne to create a mix of textures.


When the veg is ready, add the oil to a frying pan or wok and let it get hot before throwing in the veg. Carrots and cabbage take a little longer to cook so I put them in first and then the rest of the veg goes in a couple of minutes later.


Keep giving the veg a stir and turning it over so it cooks evenly and doesn’t stick. It should take 5 – 10 mins to cook through.


Add the miso, five spice and soy sauce and stir through. Finally, add the rice. Stir regularly so it doesn’t burn. Once the rice is heated through, you are good to go.

Ingredients

2 tbsp rapeseed oil
75g pitted dates
450g bramley apples – that’s about 2 medium sized bramleys
110g gluten free self-raising flour
125ml dairy free milk – I use almond milk
1 heaped tsp of egg replacer whisked together with 2 tbsp water
175g soft light brown sugar or coconut sugar if going sugar free
For the icing:
100g icing sugar
1-2 tbsp water

","
Preparation

Serves 9
You will need an 8inch/23cm square baking tin for this recipe


Method
Preheat the oven to 180c and line the baking tin with paper.
Chop the dates into small pieces and then peel and core the apples and cut into 2cm chunks.
Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre and pour in the oil, dairy free milk and egg replacer and beat together with a wooden spoon until you have a smooth and glossy batter.
Add the sugar, dates and apple pieces and fold into the mixture until combined. Spoon the mixture into the lined baking tin and level the top with the back of a spoon. Bake in the oven for 45-50 minutes until golden and cooked through.
Remove from the oven and either serve hot with dairy free custard, ice cream or cream. Alternatively, lift the bake out using the baking paper as a lever and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. While the tray bake is cooling make up the icing.
Place the icing sugar into a mixing bowl, add the water and stir together until you have a smooth icing of dropping consistency. Once the tray bake has cooled completely, drizzle over the icing before cutting into squares and serving.

5,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chilli-vegetable-pizza/,Chilli Vegetable Pizza,"
Ingredients

125g ’00’ flour
125g strong wholemeal flour
1/2 tsp dried active yeast*
4g dried chipotle mora chilli
very finely diced
5g Himalayan pink salt (or table salt)
150ml warm water
12 cherry tomatoes
1/2 red onion
1 large clove garlic
7g ancho poblano chilli
soaked with seeds
1/2 cup water
2 tblsps balsamic vinegar

","
Preparation
Makes 2 individual 8″ pizzas
Equipment

Food processor with dough blade
Pizza stone or tray
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Frying pan


Method
Add all of the flours, yeast*, salt and chipotle mora to the food processor with the dough blade and turn on.
*I only had dried active yeast to hand, so added it to the ingredients above, (ignoring the actual instructions on the container) with full success!
Pour the water in a steady trickle until you’ve used it all and the dough becomes a ball.
Take the dough out of the processor, lightly flour your surface and set the timer for 10 mins. Knead and stretch the dough the whole time – if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you’re giving them without stepping inside a gym!
Once the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that’s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Once rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds – this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.
Divide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.
* Top Tip *
I’ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don’t worry, it’s always tasted great either way!
Leave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you’re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don’t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a ‘skin’ on the outside.
* Top Tip *
The resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.
Put the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.
* Top Tip *
You can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.
Add the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It’s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist; don’t let it dry out and stick to the pan.
* Top Tip *
The sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.
Turn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you’re using a pizza tray.
* Top Tip *
For pizza stones, it’s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.
Lightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven’t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won’t have the intense heat of the stone, I’d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t overcook on top).
* Serving Suggestion *
These chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version – the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!
I honestly don’t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee’s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers – what’s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?

Ingredients

For the shortcrust pastry:
150g plain gluten-free flour
75g dairy-free soya spread
2 tsp agave nectar or maple syrup
75ml cold water
For the filling:
30g dairy-free soya spread
3 tbsp agave nectar or maple syrup
25g plain gluten-free flour
50g ground almonds
3  Nākd Bakewell Tart Bars
Flaked almonds, for decorating

","
Preparation
Serves:  20
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus 15 minutes chilling
Cooking time: 15 minutes

Method

Heat the oven to 170c and lightly grease a mini muffin tin.
Make the pastry by sifting the flour into the bowl of a food processor and adding the soya spread. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Alternatively, mix together in a bowl using your fingertips. Transfer the mixture to a separate bowl and stir in the agave nectar/maple syrup and a small amount of water at a time until a smooth dough comes together. Wrap it in cling film and leave in the fridge for 15 minutes, whilst you prepare the filling.
Make an almond Frangipane by creaming the dairy-free spread and agave nectar/maple syrup together, then adding the gluten-free flour and ground almonds, mixing until well combined.
Once the dough has chilled, roll it out between two sheets of cling film to about 1/4cm thickness. Use a cookie cutter or upside down glass to cut out pastry shells to fit into the mini muffin tin.
Start filling the shells with bits of the Nākd Bakewell Tart bars, by rolling them into small discs to fill the bottom of the shell, coming up a third of the way.
Spoon the Frangipane mixture on top and flatten with your finger to create a smooth top. Decorate with the flaked almonds and brush the tops with a little dairy-free milk.
Bake for 15 minutes, turning half way to ensure an even bake. Leave to cool and enjoy!

9,https://veganuary.com/recipes/non-dairy-garlic-herb-gournay/,Non-Dairy Garlic Herb Gournay,"
Ingredients

½ block (7 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu (not silken tofu)
3 tbsp organic refined coconut oil
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp white wine vinegar or raw apple cider vinegar
1 to 2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp dried parsley
2 tsp dried minced chives
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt
½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp coarse ground black pepper
¼ tsp dried thyme leaves
Plain unsweetened non-dairy milk to adjust consistency as needed*

","
Preparation
*Homemade almond or cashew milk is ideal because of its creamy consistency and ability to minimize the chalky undertaste of the tofu.

Method
Press the tofu to remove as much moisture as possible and then crumble into a food processor.
Remove the metal lid from the jar of coconut oil and place the jar in a microwave. Heat just until the solid oil liquefies, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (this will depend upon the solidity of the coconut oil). Alternately, place the jar in about an inch of simmering water and melt the oil in the same manner. Measure 3 tablespoons and add to the food processor with the remaining ingredients. Process the contents until very smooth.
Transfer the mixture to a container with a lid. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours to allow the flavors to blend and the cheese to firm. If desired, transfer the cheese to a decorative container and allow the cheese to soften for about 15 minutes at room temperature before serving. Gournay should be thick, yet spreadable. If the cheese is dry and crumbly, stir in small amounts of non-dairy milk until the desired consistency is achieved.
